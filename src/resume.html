                                    <strong>eBPF</strong> (extended Berkley Packet Filters) and
                                    <strong>BCC tools</strong>. My project was selected in the top three amongst twenty-five extraordinary

                                    the state of the world of the batch by superimposing the graph from the past with the
                                    current state. I made use of various technologies like

                                    in combination with frameworks like
